          The Indian Property Act, 1872, is a law that governs the transfer,
          acquisition, and devolution of property in India. It is one of the
          most important laws in India, and it has been amended several times
          since it was first enacted.

        <p class="the-indian-property">
          The Indian Property Act, 1872, applies to all property in India,
          regardless of the religion or community of the owner. It covers a wide

              categories: immovable property and movable property. Immovable
              property is land and buildings, while movable property is goods

          Public property, as we can easily predict, means the property owned by
          the State for the Indian citizens. It belongs to the public with no
          claim from an individual. The government or any assigned community
          generally manages these properties for public utility.

          As the name suggests, private property permits a non-government body
          to own the property. It is property owned by a juristic person for
          their personal use or benefit which can be of any nature tangible or
          intangible, movable or immovable.

          <b>7. Personal Property</b>

        <p class="the-indian-property">
          The personal property acts like an umbrella which includes all types
          of property. Individuals own this kind of property, be it either
          tangible or intangible.

          <b>8. Real Property</b>
        </p>
        <p class="the-indian-property">
          Real property, also called real estate property, includes land and any
          development made on such land. This kind of property is covered in
          immovable property. But why is this covered in immovable property?
          See, for example, roads, mines, buildings, factory, crops, etc, which
          is created by development, are all fixed with the land. This is
          immovable property, + any development on it, a further deliberation of
          immovable property is a real property.
        </p>
        <p class="the-indian-property">
          Other examples: Building (attached to the earth) using materials like
          cement, steel, mines, crops, etc.

          <b>9. Corporeal Property</b>
        </p>
        <p class="the-indian-property">
          Don’t get confused here. Corporeal property is any tangible property
          that can be touched and felt, If this is similar to tangible property,
          then why a separate type of corporeal property came into existence?
          This is a tangible property but it is mainly the right of ownership in
          material things of such property. All kinds of tangible property can
          be considered corporeal property. it can be divided into two
          categories: movable and immovable property and personal and real
          property as it is ownership rights.

        <p class="the-indian-property">
          <b>10. Incorporeal Property</b>
        </p>
        <p class="the-indian-property">
          Incorporeal property means all kinds of intangible property. Again,
          then why such a category is brought up? This type of property is also
          called intellectual property. It is an incorporeal right, meaning
          having legal rights over things that cannot be touched or felt.
