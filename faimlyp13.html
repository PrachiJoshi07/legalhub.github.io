          The Indian Succession Act, 1925, is a comprehensive piece of
          legislation that governs the rules and procedures related to the
          succession of property and assets in India. It applies to all
          communities in India, including Christians. The act addresses various
          aspects of succession, including wills, intestate succession (when a
          person dies without a will), and the distribution of property.
