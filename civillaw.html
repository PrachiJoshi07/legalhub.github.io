          Indian civil law is a broad body of legislation that regulates several
          facets of civil disputes, as well as individual rights and duties. It
          is founded on a combination of common law rules, codified statutes,
          and precedents. The Indian civil law system acts in tandem with the
          criminal law system to offer a complete legal framework for resolving
          civil disputes. It is principally drawn from a number of statutes and
          laws.

          As defined by the famous jurist, John Salmond, civil law is “the law
          of the State or the law of the land, the law of lawyers and the law of
          courts.”

          The term civil law is derived from the ancient Roman term “jus civile”
          literally meaning citizens’ law, which was used to denote the law
          enforced exclusively in the city of Rome. It is also called
          Romano-Germanic law.
        </p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">
          Civil law is a system of law or body of rules dealing with the civil
          or private rights of citizens and not the public at large. It is
          primarily concerned with the private relations between two or more
          citizens and is generally codified.

          >, as a legal system of codified law, was introduced by the ancient
          Roman Law called the Corpus Juris Civilis (meaning Body of Civil Law).
          It is a collection of legal works in jurisprudence, issued from 527 to
          565 AD by the imperial order of Justinian I, a Byzantine Emperor. For
          obvious reasons, it is also known as the Code of Justinian. It was
          made under the direction of Tribonian, a notable jurist in Justinian’s
          Court in Constantinople.

        <p class="indian-civil-law">
          The concepts in Corpus Juris Civilis then spread all over Europe.
          Though not as influential as in its golden days, it still serves as a
          basis for modern civil law systems around the world.

          The following are the predominant features of civil law:
        </p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="relating-to-the">
          Relating to the private rights of citizens

        <p class="welcome-to-the">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">
          As aforementioned, civil law exclusively deals with the private rights
          of citizens. It applies to the disputes between two or more
          individuals or legal entities, concerning any legal relationship or
          obligation. It is enjoyed by the citizens who inhabit a particular
          state which commands obedience through the judicial processes. Civil
          law aims to operate in two ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="protect-citizens-rights-from">
          <li class="restore-citizens-rights-in-ca">
            <span>Protect citizens’ rights from being infringed, and</span>
          </li>
          <li class="restore-citizens-rights-in-ca">
            <span>Restore citizens’ rights in case of an infringement.</span>

        <p class="welcome-to-the">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">
          One of the exclusive features of civil law is that it imposes civil
          liability on the offender. Civil liability refers to the obligation of
          a person to compensate for the damage caused to another person or his
          property. This means, the citizen who committed a civil wrong against
          another citizen, is liable to compensate, in specific, the citizen
          whom he wronged. There exists a one-to-one obligation to compensate in
          civil law. This is contrary to criminal law, wherein the criminal is
          sentenced or fined for a crime affecting society at large.
        </p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="relating-to-the">Subjective application</p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="indian-civil-law">
          The extent of application of civil laws may subjectively vary
          depending on the territory, citizens, etc.

      </div>
      <div class="civil-laws-are-container">
        <p class="welcome-to-the">
          Civil laws are almost always a set of codified laws. A codified civil
          law consists of a series of articles in the form of general rules,
          that are flexible enough to be applied to concrete circumstances. Such
          an application, however, requires judicial interpretation, considering
          the ‘spirit’ of the code.
        </p>
        <p class="welcome-to-the">
          The codification of civil laws has the following advantages:
        </p>
        <ul class="protect-citizens-rights-from">
          <li class="restore-citizens-rights-in-ca">
            It establishes greater certainty of law in a legal system. It is
            clear and specified, unlike vague customary laws, thereby making
            citizens trust the judiciary;
          </li>
          <li class="restore-citizens-rights-in-ca">
            It makes studying laws easier, as specific provisions can be
            effortlessly and systematically remembered and applied; and
          </li>
          <li>
            It can be easily amended depending on the changing needs of the
            state.

          prescribes it as a Directive Principle of State Policy, it is
          extremely challenging to bring about a “one-country-one-rule” in
          India, owing to the immense diversity of citizens. Nevertheless,
          albeit the variety of civil laws, India proves to be a near-perfect
          example of “unity in diversity”. Let’s hope the brotherhood of being
          an “Indian” transcends all the dissimilarities in opinions and
          identities forevermore.
