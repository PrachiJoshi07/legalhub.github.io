          The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, was an important piece
          of legislation in India that aimed to regulate and ensure the purity
          and quality of food products sold to consumers. This act was replaced
          by the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which has more
          comprehensive provisions for food safety and regulation. However, I
          can provide you with an overview of the Prevention of Food
          Adulteration Act, 1954, and its key provisions:

          health of consumers by regulating the quality and purity of food
          items.
