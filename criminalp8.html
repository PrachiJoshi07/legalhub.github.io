          Drug trafficking is a criminal offense that involves the illegal
          manufacturing, distribution, sale, or transportation of controlled
          substances or narcotics, typically for financial gain. In India, drug
          trafficking is primarily addressed under the Narcotic Drugs and
          Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act). The primary objectives
          of this Act are to:

              Drug trafficking cases often start with a tip-off or information
              received by law enforcement agencies. Based on this information,
              the police initiate an investigation by registering a First
              Information Report (FIR). The FIR provides details of the alleged
              drug-related activities and the individuals involved.</span

              To build a case, law enforcement agencies may conduct surveillance
