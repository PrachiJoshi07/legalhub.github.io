          Christian law is one of the five personal laws that is recognized by
          the Constitution of India, along with Hindu law, Muslim law, Parsi
          law, and Jewish law. Christian law governs the family matters of
          Christians in India, including marriage, divorce, child custody,
          maintenance, and inheritance.
        </p>
        <p class="christian-law-is">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="christian-law-is">
          The primary source of Christian law in India is the Indian Christian
          Marriage Act, 1872. The Act provides for monogamous marriages between
          Christians, and allows for divorce on a number of grounds, including
          cruelty, desertion, and adultery. The Act also provides for child
          custody and maintenance after divorce.
        </p>
        <p class="christian-law-is">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="christian-law-is">
          In addition to the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, Christian law
          in India is also influenced by the Bible and the teachings of the
          Christian church. For example, the Bible teaches that marriage is a
          sacred union between a man and a woman, and that divorce should only
          be considered in extreme cases.
