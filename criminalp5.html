        <p class="kidnapping-is-defined">

        <p class="kidnapping-is-defined">
          The primary objective of kidnapping laws in India is to protect
          individuals from unlawful abduction, restraint, or detention. These
          laws aim to safeguard the personal freedom, safety, and well-being of
          citizens. By imposing penalties on those who commit acts of
          kidnapping, the legal system seeks to maintain public order, ensure
          justice for victims, and act as a deterrent against such criminal
          behavior.
