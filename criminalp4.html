          1. With the Intention of Causing Death: If the accused person has the

          the knowledge that their actions were likely to cause the victim's
          death, it still constitutes murder.

          There is an exception mentioned in Section 300 which states that
          culpable homicide (which includes murder) is not murder if it is
          committed in the heat of passion upon sudden provocation. In such
          cases, it is treated as a lesser offense called "culpable homicide not
          amounting to murder." This exception reduces the severity of the
          punishment.
