          The Partition Act, 1893, is a piece of legislation in India that
          provides for the partition of jointly held property, whether it's held
          by tenants-in-common or joint owners. This act outlines the procedure
          for seeking partition, the rights of co-owners, and various aspects
          related to the division of property. Below are some key points about
          the Partition Act, 1893:

          The primary objective of the Partition Act, 1893, is to provide a
          legal framework for the fair and equitable division of jointly owned
          property among co-owners. It aims to resolve disputes that may arise
          among co-owners regarding the partition of property and to ensure that
          each co-owner gets their rightful share.
