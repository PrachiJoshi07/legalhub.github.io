            laws in matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. However,

            conciliation and mediation. The courts in India are encouraged to
            use conciliation and mediation to resolve family disputes before
            proceeding to trial. This is because the Indian legal system
            recognizes that family disputes are often complex and emotionally
            charged, and that trial can be a traumatic experience for the

            define spouses' rights to marital property before marriage. Couples
            with existing businesses or real estate often want to protect their
            rights in the event of a divorce. State laws require both parties to
            have the agreements reviewed by their own attorneys. A postnuptial
            agreement gives the same protection after the wedding.

            to a family law office for help in getting a protective order from
            the court.
