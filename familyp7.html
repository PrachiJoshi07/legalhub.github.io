          Divorce under Muslim Personal Law in India, also known as Talaq, is a
          process by which a Muslim marriage can be legally dissolved. It
          follows specific procedures and guidelines rooted in Islamic
          principles. Here is an overview of the divorce process under Muslim
          Personal Law:

            <span>
              This is considered the most proper and least harmful form of
              divorce. It involves a single pronouncement of Talaq followed by a
              waiting period (Iddat) during which the wife must observe a period
              of abstinence. If there is no reconciliation during this time, the
              divorce becomes final.</span

            <span>
              This type of divorce involves three pronouncements of Talaq, but
              each pronouncement is made during a woman's period of purity
              (Tuhr), with an interval of abstinence (Iddat) between them. If no
              reconciliation occurs during the Iddat, the divorce becomes
              final.</span

              three times in a single sitting. In 2019, the Indian government
              passed a law making Triple Talaq illegal and void. The Supreme
              Court of India had also declared it unconstitutional in a landmark
              judgment in 2017.</span

              After the pronouncement of Talaq, the wife must observe an Iddat

              wife's menstrual cycle and whether she is pregnant. During the
              Iddat, the husband is obligated to provide maintenance to the

          It's important to note that while Islamic law governs the religious

          issues such as maintenance, custody of children, and property
          division. Therefore, legal proceedings related to divorce can involve
          both Islamic principles and Indian civil law.
