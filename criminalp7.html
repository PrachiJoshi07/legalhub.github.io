          Riot, as a criminal offense in India, is governed primarily by
          provisions in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal
          Procedure (CrPC). Below are the key sections and laws related to
          riots:

            This section defines "rioting" as an offense. It states that
            whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly in
            prosecution of a common object, every member of such assembly is
            guilty of rioting.</span

            This section deals with rioting when the members of an unlawful
            assembly are armed with deadly weapons. It prescribes a more severe
            punishment, stating that if the rioters are armed with a deadly
            weapon, they can be punished with imprisonment for a term that may
            extend to 3 years, or with a fine, or with both.</span

            that offense. In essence, it makes all members of an unlawful

          It's important to note that the severity of the punishment may vary

          of the accused individuals in the unlawful assembly can influence the
          court's decision regarding the punishment.

        <p class="the-legal-process">
          The legal process for riot cases is designed to ensure a fair trial
