        Criminal law in India is a branch of law that deals with crimes, their
        prosecution, and the punishment of individuals who commit unlawful acts.
        It is primarily governed by the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and various
        other statutes and regulations. Here, I will explain the details,
        features, types, and classifications of criminal law in India:

          <span
            >Historically, criminal law viewed crimes as morally wrong acts. The
            primary purpose of criminal sanctions was to make offenders pay for
            the harm they caused and expiate their moral guilt. Punishment was
            intended to be proportionate to the guilt of the accused.</span

            In modern times, there has been a shift toward more rational and
            pragmatic views. Enlightenment thinkers like Cesare Beccaria
            emphasized that the primary purpose of criminal law should be the
            prevention of crime. This involves deterring potential offenders and
            reforming those who have committed crimes.</span

          <b class="public-interest">3. Protection of the Public:</b>
          <span>
            Criminal law aims to protect the interests and safety of society at
            large. It does so by defining and prohibiting certain behaviors that
            are considered harmful or dangerous to the public.</span

          <b class="public-interest">4. Rehabilitation of Offenders:</b>
          <span>
            Criminal law also seeks to rehabilitate offenders. This means
            providing them with opportunities for personal growth, education,
            and training during their incarceration, so they can reintegrate
            into society as law-abiding citizens after serving their
            sentences.</span

          <b>5. Fair Warning:</b>
          <span>
            Criminal laws should provide individuals with clear and unambiguous
            notice of what constitutes an offense. This principle ensures that
            people are aware of the conduct that is prohibited and punishable by
            law.</span

          <span>
            Laws should not be applied retroactively. In other words,
            individuals should not be prosecuted for conduct that was not a
            crime at the time they engaged in it.</span

          <span>
            Legal systems typically have protections against prosecuting a
            person multiple times for the same offense. These protections ensure
            that individuals are not subjected to repeated trials for the same
            conduct.</span

                In some cases, instead of sending an individual to prison, the
                court may opt for probation. Probation is a form of conditional
                release where the convicted person is allowed to remain in the
                community but must adhere to specific conditions set by the
                court. These conditions can include regular reporting to a
                probation officer, staying away from certain places or
                individuals, and participating in rehabilitation or counseling
                programs</span

                As a form of punishment, the court may order an offender to
                perform community service. This involves the convicted person
                contributing their time and effort to benefit the community,
                such as cleaning public spaces, assisting in charitable
                activities, or participating in other community-oriented tasks.
                The nature and duration of community service are determined by
                the court.</span

                >The death penalty is the most severe punishment in India's
                legal system and is reserved for exceptionally grave crimes such
                as murder, acts of terrorism, and certain cases of treason. It
                is a controversial issue in India, and its application has been
                a subject of debate and legal challenges. In recent years, there
                has been a move towards reducing the use of the death penalty,
                with a focus on considering alternative punishments for heinous
                crimes.</span
