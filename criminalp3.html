          Rape is a criminal offense and a serious violation of a person's
          bodily autonomy and sexual consent. It is defined as the act of
          engaging in sexual intercourse or sexual penetration with another
          person without their consent or against their will. Rape can involve
          physical force, threats, intimidation, or taking advantage of a person
          who is unable to give informed and voluntary consent due to factors
          such as age, intoxication, mental incapacity, or physical incapacity.

            It's important to note that, as of my last knowledge update, Indian
            law does not consider non-consensual sexual intercourse within a
            marriage as rape, provided the wife is above the age of 15. There
            has been ongoing debate and advocacy for the criminalization of
            marital rape in India.</span
